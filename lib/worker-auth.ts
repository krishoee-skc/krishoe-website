 * Resolves the signed-in worker to the factory record their pairs and wages are

 *
 * This used to go through employee_id into hr_employees, but the shop floor
 * runs on the factory_* tables and the HR module holds no attendance or
 * payroll — so the portal showed an empty page beside a full one. The link is
 * an explicit factory_worker_id rather than a name match, because two workers
 * can share a name and matching on one is how wages get attributed to the
 * wrong person.
